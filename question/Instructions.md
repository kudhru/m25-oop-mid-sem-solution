### Extra Notes about Eclipse IDE

1. For enabling full support of Auto-completion features in Eclipse IDE, please go to Settings/Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Advanced -> and make sure that the check boxes for Java Proposals, Java Type Proposals and Java Non-Type Proposals are checked.

2. If the javadocs are not working in Eclipse and it is saying "Source Not Found", you can attach the source by clicking on the "Attach Source" button and adding the path `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_321\src.zip`.
